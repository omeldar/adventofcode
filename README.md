# Advent of Code

This repository shows my solution of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

## Events

I have started participating on the events in the year 2018 in my 2nd year of my software engineering apprenticeship. I dont have the 2018 and 2019 code anymore but I started submitting them to GitHub in 2020. 

### 2020
In this year I was still in my software enginerring apprenticeship and mainly used C# at work. Thats why I pretty much only used C# for the challenges.

### 2021
2021 was my last year of the apprenticeship and I have used some other technologies which I have used for the challenges as well. I mainly used Javascript for the challenges but I have as well tried something with C# and used python as well.

### 2022
Current Year, lets see what happens
